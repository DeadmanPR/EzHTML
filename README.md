# EzHTML

EzHTML is a programming language that helps people create web pages (or websites). It offers a syntax similar to C/C++, so that people that know these languages can easily grasp EzHTML's syntax. 

Note: This project was developed using Python Lex-Yacc (PLY for short). Therefore, you must have Python 2.7 installed on your computer.


# How to execute the test program provided:
    1- Download the project as a ZIP file, and extract it somewhere on your 
    computer.
    2- Open your terminal, locate the folder to which you extracted the ZIP
    file.
    3- Type "python myParse.py"
    4- The parser will start executing and will ask you for the name of the 
    source code file.
    5- Since this is a test program, type "sourceCode" and hit the <Enter>
    key. You can type any file name, as long as it has valid EzHTML syntax.
    6- If everything worked correctly, the website should open up in your
    default internet browser.
