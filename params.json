  "body": "# EzHTML\r\n\r\nEzHTML is a programming language that helps people create web pages (or websites). It offers a syntax similar to C/C++, so that people that know these languages can easily grasp EzHTML's syntax. \r\n\r\nNote: This project was developed using Python Lex-Yacc (PLY for short). Therefore, you must have Python 2.7 installed on your computer.\r\n\r\n\r\n# How to execute the test program provided:\r\n    1- Download the project as a ZIP file, and extract it somewhere on your \r\n    computer.\r\n    2- Open your terminal, locate the folder to which you extracted the ZIP\r\n    file.\r\n    3- Type \"python myParse.py\"\r\n    4- The parser will start executing and will ask you for the name of the \r\n    source code file.\r\n    5- Since this is a test program, type \"sourceCode\" and hit the <Enter>\r\n    key. You can type any file name, as long as it has valid EzHTML syntax.\r\n    6- If everything worked correctly, the website should open up in your\r\n    default internet browser.\r\n\r\n# More notes on syntax will be added later\r\n",
